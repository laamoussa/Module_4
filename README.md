Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze the reading and math scores of a district school. We were instructed to organize the data by school type, grade, budget, and size. We were also instructed to use the code from PyCitySchools_Challenge_testing to pull out the data from Thomas High School 9th grade and analyze it. 

Results
We realize the Average math and reading grades of the 9th-grade students from Thomas High School dropped from 79.0 to 78.9 when we replaced some of the grades with NaN. The changes in the scores also affect the summary of the district's grades.

0	15	39,170	$24,649,428.00	78.9	81.9	74.8	85.7	0.6


There are also changes in the average reading and math scores and the percent passing math. The math and the reading values changed slightly when the 9th graders from Thomas High School were removed. Ordinally, when the scores were changed to NaN, the averages changed slightly, and the percentages dropped significantly. However, when the total student count was adjusted and the 9th graders were removed from the count, the percent passing increased to similar to the original.

Summary
Finally, we realize that four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs are as follows: First, the math average decreased from 83.42 to 83.35. Secondly, the reading Average increased from 83.85 to 83.90, math Percent Passed decreased from 93.27 to 93.19, and the Reading Percent Passed decreased from 97.31 to 97.02
